This project scrapes daily box office data from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) for all movies shown in American theaters between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2020. It collects this information into a structured CSV file, allowing further analysis using Python and Pandas.

## üìä Project Purpose

The main goal is to create a comprehensive dataset that shows:
- Which movies were shown each day in U.S. theaters
- How much domestic gross each movie earned
- Which distributors dominated the market

Using this dataset, you can explore long-term industry trends, market shares of studios, and daily movie performance.
